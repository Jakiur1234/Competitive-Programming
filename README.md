# C++ Competitive Programming Template

## Introduction

This repository provides a versatile C++ template for competitive programming. It includes commonly used macros, utility functions, and a structured main function for quick and efficient problem-solving. The template is designed to be easily customizable and comes with features to aid in debugging and optimization.

## License

This template is distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Instructions

To use this template in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone git clone https://github.com/Jakiur1234/Competitive-Programming
    cd Competitive-Programming
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to "File" -> "Preferences" -> "User Snippets".
- Select "cpp.json" to edit the C++ snippets.
- Copy and paste the contents of `cpp_snippet.json` into the `cpp.json` file.
- Save the file.
- Start coding! Customize the `solve` function to implement your solutions.

## Usage

### Input/Output Macros

- `SC(a)`: Read a variable from standard input.
- `SIG()`: Ignore the remaining characters in the current line.
- `SS(s)`: Read a string from standard input.

### Debugging Macros

- Use `dbg(...)` for easy debugging when the `LOCAL` macro is defined.

### Utility Functions

- Overloaded output operators for pairs and containers.
- Various commonly used utility functions for debugging and manipulation.

### Main Function Structure

- Standard competitive programming main function structure with a loop for multiple test cases.

### Performance Optimization

- Compiler optimization pragma for faster execution.

### RNG (Random Number Generator)

- A seeded random number generator for shuffling containers.

## Advantages and Features

- **Versatility:** Easily adaptable for different problem-solving scenarios.
- **Debugging Support:** Integrated debugging macros for quick and easy debugging in the `LOCAL` environment.
- **Performance Optimization:** Compiler optimization pragma for faster execution.
- **Standard Structure:** Follows a standard competitive programming structure for familiarity and ease of use.
- **Concise Macros:** Short and easy-to-remember macros for common C++ functionalities.
- **Common Data Types:** Convenient aliases for common data types like vectors, pairs, maps, and more.
- **Math and Constants:** Definitions for mathematical constants and utility functions.
- **Random Number Generation:** A random number generator setup for quick use in contests.
- **File I/O Setup:** Basic setup for efficient file I/O in contests.
